# PU90PX | PHOTOGRAPHER

Welcome to PU90PX, a website with photos taken by the photographer Pontus Unosson.
I've built this album-website for him to share his work with others. 

Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django frameworks to create this project, it offers a responsive experience across all devices. The content is easy to navigate and the design has a scandinavian clean touch to it. 

As a visitor to the site, you will find different albums sorted in themes. From nature to animals to city and cars. The visitor is able to interact by commenting on the posts. This is free of charge and the user only has to register for an account.

### Agile Methodology

Before I started on the project I consulted the client (The photographer) what he wished to have on the site. I then created a board of user stories to section up and determine what was needed to be done using Mosow method. 

The User Story Board can be vied [here.](https://github.com/users/GigiLi89/projects/5)
